# Ray Tracing app

A high-performance ray tracing application written in C++ with a focus on modularity and real-time rendering. This project leverages modern graphics libraries to provide a robust and interactive environment for exploring ray tracing techniques.

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the way light interacts with objects in a scene to produce highly realistic images. By tracing the paths of individual rays of light, the algorithm calculates reflections, refractions, and shadows.

## Features
- Real-time ray tracing using OpenGL
- Interactive GUI with ImGui
- Cross-platform support via GLFW and CMake
